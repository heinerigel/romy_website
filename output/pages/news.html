<h4><small>March 2018</small> BlueSeis is going into space! New H2020 proposal submitted!</h4>
<p>The ROMY scientists have promoted for some time that the 6C measurement concept is particularly interesting for planetary observations. LMU is involved in a new proposal called PIONEERS under the H2020 call “Scientific instrumentation and technologies enabling space science and exploration” aiming at the development of an optical technology based 6C sensor concept for space. The project shall be coordinated by Institut Superieur de l’Aeoronautique et de l‘ Espace in France and involves IPG Paris, ETH Zurich, and iXblue.
<br></br></p>
<h4><small>January 2018</small> EU-Training Network Proposal submitted</h4>
<p>A proposal for an EU-funded training network called SPIN (Seismological Parameters and Instrumentation) was submitted in January. The project shall fill the gap in training of young Earth scientists in the field of modern instrumentation concepts including the observation of rotational motions as well as the emerging field of distributed acoustic sensing.  The project shall be coordinated by the Univ. of Hamburg and involves LMU Munich, ETH Zurich, iXblue, IPG Paris, GFZ Potsdam, the Univ. of Grenoble, and others.

<h4><small> October/November 2017 </small> BlueSeis in the Cathedral of Cologne</h4>
<p>Together with scientists from the <a href="http://www.seismo.uni-koeln.de/station/index.htm">Erdbebenstation Bensberg</a>, University of Cologne, led by Klaus Hinzen, three portable rotational motion sensors, one of them BlueSeis3A, were installed in the cathedral of cologne, one of the UNESCO world cultural heritage sites. The sensors were installed together with 3C broadband seismometers on three different stories of the north tower. The aim of this experiment is to observe rotational eigenmodes and the absolute movement of the tower as well as to explore the advantage of 6C measurements for structural engineering applications.</p>

<h4><small> mid September 2017 </small> Presenting the blueSeis concept in Beijing, China</h4>
<p>Frederic Guattari and co-workers from iXBlue and Heiner Igel (LMU) visited Beijing, China, in the week of September 18, 2017 to present the blueSeis concept to the Chinese seismological community. blueSeis will be distributed and serviced through the local company. The concept was presented at the Chinese Earthquake Administration and the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. An experiment with the blueSeis sensor was carried out in an underground laboratory North of Beijing. Joint sessions on the topic of new instrumentation strategies are planned for the memorial meeting of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake to be organized in 2018.</p>

<h4><small> mid September 2017 </small> Leak discovered in the ROMY cavity</h4>
<p>After observing that the vacuum deteriorated slowly in one of the four ROMY rings, first, all O-rings were replaced which did not lead to any improvement. Finally one has to resort to a leak detection system using Helium. A device is connected to the vacuum and measures the amount of Helium inside the cavity. Then, Helium is blown from outside in areas where the leak is likely to be (e.g. corners, connections). The sudden increase in Helium content inside the cavity is then an indication for a leak at the specific location. Luckily there was an obvious location at one of the corner windows. Since the Helium experiment in mid September the window was replaced and the leak is now fixed!</p>

<p>Finally, the practical introduction on computational seismology, written by Heiner Igel, is <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/computational-seismology-9780198717416?cc=de&amp;lang=en&amp;">now available</a>. This book is an introductory text to a range of numerical methods used today to simulate time-dependent processes in Earth science, physics, engineering, and many other fields. It also includes simulation methods used in the ROMY project. The theoretical concepts presented in the book are complemented by interactive Jupyter Notebooks at the <a href="seismo-live.org">seismo-live webpage</a>.</p>

<h4><small>November 2016</small> First weak rotational motion measurement of structural health monitoring on a spectacular building</h4>
<p>End of November a group from LMU Munich was joining a campaign led by scientists of the <a href="http://www.dst.unifi.it/">Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra</a>, Univercity of Florence, led by Maurizio Ripepe, to measure the eigenvibrations of Gampanile di Giotto, the bells tower of the famous dome of Florence. Using two rotational motion sensors and 9 broadband seismometers the joint group will try to validate resent simulations and measurements performed by civil engineers and the Florence group, respectively.</p>

<h4><small>26/30th October 2016</small> Data from central Italy</h4>
<p>The earthquakes in central Italy on 26th and 30th of October provided us an opportunity for a first check on our new, rotational instruments. The events have been recorded on the vertical component of our ringlaser and on the 3-component portable BlueSeis prototype. Here are first impressions:</p>
<p><em>Right picture:</em>
Recording of the M6.6 Norcia event. Top is the vertical component of the ringlaser. The remaining traces are the three component of the BlueSeis prototype (1-N, 2-E, 3-Z). Data are lowpass filtered at 2Hz.</p>
<p><em>Left picture:</em>
Same event. Cross-correlation of the ringlaser data (vertical component of rotation) with the transversal component of acceleration of station GR.FUR. Top subplot shows the bandpass filtered waveforms. The middle subplot shows the CC coefficients for varying backazimuths. The highest coefficients indicate the backazimuth of the event. Bottom subplot shows the phase velocities accociated with CC coefficients higher than 0.75.  Details of processing and theory can be found in e.g. <a href="https://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/~hadzii/files/hadzii2012_JoS.pdf">Hadziioannou et al., 2012</a>.</p>

<h4><small>24th October 2016</small> Romy hears the ocean!</h4>
<p>Below is a figure comparing the secondary microseism band observed by ringlaser ROMY in Fürstenfeldbruck to the same timespan observed with the G-ring laser in Wettzell, at a distance of 160 km to the North-East. As shown in <a href="https://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/~hadzii/files/hadzii2012_JoS.pdf">Hadziioannou et al., (2012)</a>, the G-Ring at Wettzell has sufficient sensitivity to pick up the ocean-generated noise in the secondary microseism (around 0.1-0.2Hz). Here, we are looking at an hour of 'quiet' signal, where no earthquakes can be seen. This figure shows that the first ring of ROMY very likely picks up the same oceanic noise sources as the ring in Wettzell. </p>
<p>The left column shows the situation measured at the observatory in Fürstenfeldbruck. For reference, on the right the same time window is shown as measured at the Wettzell observatory. </p>
<p>The top row shows the waveforms, bandpass filtered between 0.1-0.2Hz. 
In red is the vertical rotation rate measured by the ringlasers (ROMY, G-Ring), in black the transverse acceleration measured by broadband seismometers nearby (GR.FUR, GR.WET). </p>
<p>In the bottom two rows, the colorscale indicates correlation coefficient between the rotation rate and transverse acceleration, for each 60 second timewindow (red=1, gray=-1). 
The center row depicts the the maximum values of the zero-lag correlation coefficient for each timewindow. For both observatories, we see pretty good correlation values, a strong indication that both instruments at each location (seismometer and ring laser) are picking up the same physical signal. </p>
<p>The lowermost row shows a 'sweep' through all possible backazimuths, done for each timewindow. Red colors indicate backazimuths where the match between rotation and transverse waveform is good. The black dots mark the best correlation for each timewindow. Since the backazimuth is defined as clockwise from North, the strongest source we pick up here (between 250--300 degrees)  seems to be in the direction of the North Atlantic. This is consistent for both observatory locations. </p>
<p>Processing is similar to that in Hadziioannou et al. (2012) and to the processing used for the <a href="http://www.rotational-seismology.org/data/eventdb">Rotational Event Database</a>.

<h4><small>September/October 2016</small> Field work on Stromboli with portable rotation sensors</h4>
<p>From September 23 to October 14 a small expedition is working on Stromboli volcano. This is the first field work with some prototypes of a portable sensor for rotational ground motion (<a href="www.blueseis.com">BlueSeis-3A</a>) from the company <a href="www.ixblue.com">iXblue</a>. In addition, standard broadband seismometers and tiltmeters are installed. Therefore, we have a collocated observation of direct and array-derived measurements for translation, rotation, and strain.</p>

<h4><small>2016/09/09</small> Outer array finalized</h4>
<p>Apart from the ringlaser and the three borehole stations on the observatory ground, we have installed five additional stations. They surround the observatory at a distance of about 2 km. Their installation began in August 2015 and is now finalized. Together with the data from the borehole stations, their data will be used to calculate array-derived rotation in order to compare it with the direct observations of the ringlaser.</p>
<p>The blue triangle marks the observatory, the stars show the positions of the outer stations.</p>
