### <small>September 2014</small> Workshop: The Earth's Hum 

The Earth continuously hums a tune, at very low frequencies, audible only to sensitive geophysical instruments. The development and installation of a novel rotational sensor, currently underway at the LMU, will allow us to more closely study the toroidal modes which contribute to the Earth's Hum. Within the scope of the visit of Prof. Toshiro Tanimoto a workshop centered around the Earth's Hum will take place on 12th September 2014 in the building of the [Center for Advanced Studies (CAS)](http://www.en.cas.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html) in Munich.
