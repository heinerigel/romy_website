#### <small>December 2017</small> Special session at AGU
At the AGU in New Orleans from 11-15 December we offer a special session on *GRound translation, strain, rotation: Using Wavefield Gradients for Seismic Applications* (Session ID: 23314). Note that abstract submission is already open. Deadline is  **August 2, 2017**.  In total, the **[Romy group presents 11 contribution](../docs/AbstraktListe.pdf)** within this and other sessions. 

Session Description:  
Substantial recent progress in seismic instrumentation and array technology has opened new roads in using wavefield gradients, strain, and rotation for several seismic applications. Collocated recordings of translation, strain, and rotation provide access to subsurface velocity information, improve the resolution of source inverse problems, help separating seismic phases, and provide information on propagation directions. In addition – due to the sensitivity of classic broadband seismometers to tilt – high quality measurements of ground rotations can remove the ambiguities of horizontal ground motion measurements for example for ocean-bottom recordings or recordings of long-period signals on volcanoes. In this session we invite papers on new developments of seismic instrumentation to access gradient information (e.g., rotation sensors), small scale array measurements and analysis, and applications such as imaging, source inversion, wavefield reconstruction, instrument correction, single station observations 
in planetary seismology and theoretical developments.  
Primary Convener: **Heiner Igel**, Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, Munich, Germany  
Conveners: **Cedric Schmelzbach**, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, **Nori Nakata**, University of Oklahoma Norman Campus, Norman, OK, United States and **Bor-Shouh Huang**, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan

#### <small>July 2017</small> Official Romy inauguration 
The ROMY ring laser – already featured by a news article in Science (“Lord of the Rings”, Science, Vol. 356, Issue 6335, pp. 236-238, 2017) – will officially be inaugurated on July 21, 2017, in a ceremony to be held at the Monastery Fürstenfeldbruck (“kleiner Saal”) from 11 am. Guest lecturer will be Prof. Dr. Harald Schuh (GFZ Potsdam) speaking about “New roads in modern geodesy”. The presentations will be in German. An invitation can be found [here](../docs/invitation_inauguration.pdf). The event is open to the public! In the afternoon there will be an occasion to visit the ring laser structure at the Geophysical Observatory Fürstenfeldbruck, Ludwigshöhe 8.

#### <small>April 2017 </small> Romy at EGU

Again, there will be a special session on *New developments in seismic and geodetic instrumentation (SM 5.2)* at the [EGU General Assembly](http://www.egu2017.eu/) from 23 to 28 April in Vienna. In addition, the members of the Romy group have submitted several contributions related to the ROMY project:

* Gebauer et al. - Design and construction of a large 4C ring laser: ROMY (EGU2 017-10170)
* Bernauer et al. - BlueSeis3A - full characterization of a 3C broadband rotational ground motion sensor for seismology (EGU 2017-15512)
* Donner et al. - Inversion for seismic moment tensors from 6-component waveform data (EGU 2017-3509)
* Chow et al. - The development of a rotational magnitude scale (EGU 2017-4064)
* Joshi et al. - The case for 6-component ground motion observations in planetary seismology (EGU 2017-3840)

We kindly invite you to meet us there.

#### <small>June 2016</small> IWGoRS Meeting, Germany

In 2016 the [International Working Group on Rotational Seismology](http://www.rotational-seismology.org) will meet. 
Registration for the 3-day meeting is now open. The 4th IWGoRS workshop will be held at the 
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing (near Munich, Germany), June 20-23, 2016. The workshop will focus 
on any aspect of rotational ground motion including the recording of rotations, instrumentation, 
earthquake sources, non-standard rheologies, inverse problems, geodesy, earthquake engineering, 
long-period seismology, array-derived rotation, noise-correlation studies, ring laser technology, 
Earth's rotation, problems of fundamental physics and others. The meeting is co-funded by the 
ERC project ROMY.

#### <small>April 2016</small> Special session at EGU

At the General Assembly from 17 to 22 April in Vienna, we organise a special session on *New developments in seismic and geodetic instrumentation* (SM 7.2/G 6.2). We kindly invite you to meet us there.

#### <small>June/July 2015</small> IUGG General Assembly, Prague

On the [26th General Assembly of IUGG](http://www.iugg2015prague.com) this year in Prague, there will be a special session on Rotational Seismologie: "S06e Strong Ground Motion: Rotational Seismology". Contributions will be on any aspects of direct or indirect (array-based) measurements, interpretation, or theoretical aspects of rotational ground motions, and progress in rotation sensor development.

#### <small>September 2014</small> Workshop: The Earth's Hum 

The Earth continuously hums a tune, at very low frequencies, audible only to sensitive geophysical instruments. The development and installation of a novel rotational sensor, currently underway at the LMU, will allow us to more closely study the toroidal modes which contribute to the Earth's Hum. Within the scope of the visit of Prof. Toshiro Tanimoto a workshop centered around the Earth's Hum will take place on 12th September 2014 in the building of the [Center for Advanced Studies (CAS)](http://www.en.cas.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html) in Munich.
