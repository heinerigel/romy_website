#### <small>April 2017 </small> Romy at EGU

Again, there will be a special session on *New developments in seismic and geodetic instrumentation (SM 5.2)* at the [EGU General Assembly](http://www.egu2017.eu/) from 23 to 28 April in Vienna. In addition, the members of the Romy group have submitted several contributions related to the ROMY project:

* Schreiber et al. - Integration and initial operation of the multi-component large ring laser structure ROMY (EGU 2017-5628)
* Gebauer et al. - Design and construction of a large 4C ring laser: ROMY (EGU2 017-10170)
* Bernauer et al. - BlueSeis3A - full characterization of a 3C broadband rotational ground motion sensor for seismology (EGU 2017-15512)
* Donner et al. - Inversion for seismic moment tensors from 6-component waveform data (EGU 2017-3509)
* Chow et al. - The development of a rotational magnitude scale (EGU 2017-4064)
* Joshi et al. - The case for 6-component ground motion observations in planetary seismology (EGU 2017-3840)

We kindly invite you to meet us there.

#### <small>June 2016</small> IWGoRS Meeting, Germany

In 2016 the [International Working Group on Rotational Seismology](http://www.rotational-seismology.org) will meet. 
Registration for the 3-day meeting is now open. The 4th IWGoRS workshop will be held at the 
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing (near Munich, Germany), June 20-23, 2016. The workshop will focus 
on any aspect of rotational ground motion including the recording of rotations, instrumentation, 
earthquake sources, non-standard rheologies, inverse problems, geodesy, earthquake engineering, 
long-period seismology, array-derived rotation, noise-correlation studies, ring laser technology, 
Earth's rotation, problems of fundamental physics and others. The meeting is co-funded by the 
ERC project ROMY.

#### <small>April 2016</small> Special session at EGU

At the General Assembly from 17 to 22 April in Vienna, we organise a special session on *New developments in seismic and geodetic instrumentation* (SM 7.2/G 6.2). We kindly invite you to meet us there.

#### <small>June/July 2015</small> IUGG General Assembly, Prague

On the [26th General Assembly of IUGG](http://www.iugg2015prague.com) this year in Prague, there will be a special session on Rotational Seismologie: "S06e Strong Ground Motion: Rotational Seismology". Contributions will be on any aspects of direct or indirect (array-based) measurements, interpretation, or theoretical aspects of rotational ground motions, and progress in rotation sensor development.

#### <small>September 2014</small> Workshop: The Earth's Hum 

The Earth continuously hums a tune, at very low frequencies, audible only to sensitive geophysical instruments. The development and installation of a novel rotational sensor, currently underway at the LMU, will allow us to more closely study the toroidal modes which contribute to the Earth's Hum. Within the scope of the visit of Prof. Toshiro Tanimoto a workshop centered around the Earth's Hum will take place on 12th September 2014 in the building of the [Center for Advanced Studies (CAS)](http://www.en.cas.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html) in Munich.
