#### <small>9 February 2017 </small> Romy recorded local earthquake

On February 9th at 08:14 UTC an earthquake with a local magnitude of ML 3.5 occurred close to the Italian city Trento in a depth of about 13km. This is about 300 km of the Romy ringlaser and is the closest earthquake Romy has successfully recorded so far. The figure shows the recording with amplitudes in rad/s.

#### <small>January 2017 </small> Free-riding at the Nagra - 3D seismic in Switzerland

From October 2016 to February 2017 the [Nagra](http://www.nagra.ch), the Swiss company for finding a long-term solution for radioactive waste, performed a [large-scale 3D seismic campaign](http://www.nagra.ch/en/news/mediareleasedetail/large-scale-3d-seismic-campaign-complete.htm). Together with colleagues from ETH Zurich, we used this chance for our own measurements. Four prototypes of the portable rotation sensors from the company [iXblue](www.ixblue.com) were buried in the ground close to Eligsau for about three weeks  to record the vibration sources of the Nagra experiment.

#### <small>December 2016 </small> Book launch "Computational Seismology"

Finally, the practical introduction on computational seismology, written by Heiner Igel, is [now available](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/computational-seismology-9780198717416?cc=de&lang=en&). This book is an introductory text to a range of numerical methods used today to simulate time-dependent processes in Earth science, physics, engineering, and many other fields. It also includes simulation methods used in the ROMY project. The theoretical concepts presented in the book are complemented by interactive Jupyter Notebooks at the [seismo-live webpage](seismo-live.org).

#### <small>November 2016</small> First weak rotational motion measurement of structural health monitoring on a spectacular building

End of November a group from LMU Munich was joining a campaign led by scientists of the [Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra](http://www.dst.unifi.it/), Univercity of Florence, led by Maurizio Ripepe, to measure the eigenvibrations of Gampanile di Giotto, the bells tower of the famous dome of Florence. Using two rotational motion sensors and 9 broadband seismometers the joint group will try to validate resent simulations and measurements performed by civil engineers and the Florence group, respectively.

#### <small>26/30th October 2016</small> Data from central Italy

The earthquakes in central Italy on 26th and 30th of October provided us an opportunity for a first check on our new, rotational instruments. The events have been recorded on the vertical component of our ringlaser and on the 3-component portable BlueSeis prototype. Here are first impressions:

*Right picture:*
Recording of the M6.6 Norcia event. Top is the vertical component of the ringlaser. The remaining traces are the three component of the BlueSeis prototype (1-N, 2-E, 3-Z). Data are lowpass filtered at 2Hz.

*Left picture:*
Same event. Cross-correlation of the ringlaser data (vertical component of rotation) with the transversal component of acceleration of station GR.FUR. Top subplot shows the bandpass filtered waveforms. The middle subplot shows the CC coefficients for varying backazimuths. The highest coefficients indicate the backazimuth of the event. Bottom subplot shows the phase velocities accociated with CC coefficients higher than 0.75.  Details of processing and theory can be found in e.g. [Hadziioannou et al., 2012](https://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/~hadzii/files/hadzii2012_JoS.pdf).

#### <small>24th October 2016</small> Romy hears the ocean! 

Below is a figure comparing the secondary microseism band observed by ringlaser ROMY in Fürstenfeldbruck to the same timespan observed with the G-ring laser in Wettzell, at a distance of 160 km to the North-East. As shown in [Hadziioannou et al., (2012)](https://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/~hadzii/files/hadzii2012_JoS.pdf), the G-Ring at Wettzell has sufficient sensitivity to pick up the ocean-generated noise in the secondary microseism (around 0.1-0.2Hz). Here, we are looking at an hour of 'quiet' signal, where no earthquakes can be seen. This figure shows that the first ring of ROMY very likely picks up the same oceanic noise sources as the ring in Wettzell. 

The left column shows the situation measured at the observatory in Fürstenfeldbruck. For reference, on the right the same time window is shown as measured at the Wettzell observatory. 

The top row shows the waveforms, bandpass filtered between 0.1-0.2Hz. 
In red is the vertical rotation rate measured by the ringlasers (ROMY, G-Ring), in black the transverse acceleration measured by broadband seismometers nearby (GR.FUR, GR.WET). 

In the bottom two rows, the colorscale indicates correlation coefficient between the rotation rate and transverse acceleration, for each 60 second timewindow (red=1, gray=-1). 
The center row depicts the the maximum values of the zero-lag correlation coefficient for each timewindow. For both observatories, we see pretty good correlation values, a strong indication that both instruments at each location (seismometer and ring laser) are picking up the same physical signal. 

The lowermost row shows a 'sweep' through all possible backazimuths, done for each timewindow. Red colors indicate backazimuths where the match between rotation and transverse waveform is good. The black dots mark the best correlation for each timewindow. Since the backazimuth is defined as clockwise from North, the strongest source we pick up here (between 250--300 degrees)  seems to be in the direction of the North Atlantic. This is consistent for both observatory locations. 

Processing is similar to that in Hadziioannou et al. (2012) and to the processing used for the [Rotational Event Database](http://www.rotational-seismology.org/data/eventdb).

#### <small>September/October 2016</small> Field work on Stromboli with portable rotation sensors

From September 23 to October 14 a small expedition is working on Stromboli volcano. This is the first field work with some prototypes of a portable sensor for rotational ground motion ([BlueSeis-3A](www.blueseis.com)) from the company [iXblue](www.ixblue.com). In addition, standard broadband seismometers and tiltmeters are installed. Therefore, we have a collocated observation of direct and array-derived measurements for translation, rotation, and strain.

#### <small>2016/09/09</small> Outer array finalized

Apart from the ringlaser and the three borehole stations on the observatory ground, we have installed five additional stations. They surround the observatory at a distance of about 2 km. Their installation began in August 2015 and is now finalized. Together with the data from the borehole stations, their data will be used to calculate array-derived rotation in order to compare it with the direct observations of the ringlaser.

The blue triangle marks the observatory, the stars show the positions of the outer stations.

#### <small>February 2016</small> Beginn of construction for the ringlaser

Finally, the construction has started! At the end of February the construction company started to dig the 33 by 15 meter hole (diameter x depth) for the first-of-its-kind 3-component tetrahedral ringlaser. We expect the end of the construction and installation within this summer. With this new instrument it will be possible to observe the complete 3D field of rotational ground motions for the first time.
