#### <small>June/July 2015</small> IUGG General Assembly, Prague

On the [26th General Assembly of IUGG](http://www.iugg2015prague.com) this year in Prague, there will be a special session on Rotational Seismologie: "S06e Strong Ground Motion: Rotational Seismology". Contributions will be on any aspects of direct or indirect (array-based) measurements, interpretation, or theoretical aspects of rotational ground motions, and progress in rotation sensor development.

#### <small>September 2014</small> Workshop: The Earth's Hum 

The Earth continuously hums a tune, at very low frequencies, audible only to sensitive geophysical instruments. The development and installation of a novel rotational sensor, currently underway at the LMU, will allow us to more closely study the toroidal modes which contribute to the Earth's Hum. Within the scope of the visit of Prof. Toshiro Tanimoto a workshop centered around the Earth's Hum will take place on 12th September 2014 in the building of the [Center for Advanced Studies (CAS)](http://www.en.cas.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html) in Munich. Further information can be found [here](WShum.html).
