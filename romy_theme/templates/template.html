                <p class="lead section-lead">A new observable for Earth Sciences, Structural Engineering and Cosmology</p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                When the ground shakes from earthquakes, the oceans, or the
                atmosphere, it not only translates (up-down, sideways), but
                also undergoes rotational motions. To fully characterize
                seismic sources and wave fields theoreticians have insisted for
                decades that these motions should also be measured. However,
                this was hampered by the substantial technical difficulties in
                observing rotational motions with the necessary sensitivity.
                This implies that the observation of the complete ground motion
                is still an unsolved problem. Based on promising pilot studies
                in the past years, we aim at breaking new ground with an
                innovative instrumentation strategy that would allow solving
                this outstanding problem. If the strategy is successful the new
                observable is expected to have an impact in a wide range of
                fields making it a classical high-risk high-gain situation. We
                aim at the establishment of the first-of-its-kind six-component
                seismic observatory based on ring-laser technology, the field
                deployment of portable fibre-optic based rotation sensors,  the
                integration of the  new observations with the global
                seismological data infrastructure, and the reporting of
                discoveries in a variety of fields based on the new observable.
                At the end of the project we expect to have substantially
                pushed forward the emerging field field of rotational
                seismology with new standards, and recommendations for the use
                of rotation sensors in Earth sciences and engineering. We
                expect advances in understanding 1) the dynamics of volcano’s
                interior, 2) the origin of the Earth’s ocean generated noise
                field, 3) and seismic inverse problems for structure and source
                using the new rotational observables.
