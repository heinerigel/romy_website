#### <small>April 2016</small> News from EGU, Vienna

At the EGU General Assembly in Vienna Prof. Ullrich Schreiber (ring laser specialist in ROMY project) receives Christiaan Huygens Medal. congratulations!

Also, plans for a new broadband rotation sensor by iXBlue (St. Germain-en-Laye near Paris) launched during the instrumentation session. During the session the official www page of the new rotation sensor called BlueSeis-3A was launched. The first prototype shall be shipped to LMU in September 2016. <br></br>

#### <small>April 2016</small> Touch down

The deepest point of the ringlaser construction is touched - the hole is finished. After finalising the base, the construction of the tetrahedral structures will start from bottom to top.

#### <small>March 2016</small> Medial attention

On March 31st the local newspaper of Fuerstenfeldbruck *Merkur* became interested in our project and construction activities. The full article you can find [here](http://www.merkur.de/lokales/fuerstenfeldbruck/fuerstenfeldbruck/krater-erdbebenforscher-6265455.html) (in German).

#### <small>February 2016</small> Beginn of construction for the ringlaser

Finally, the construction has started! At the end of February the construction company started to dig the 33 by 15 meter hole (diameter x depth) for the first-of-its-kind 3-component tetrahedral ringlaser. We expect the end of the construction and installation within this summer. With this new instrument it will be possible to observe the complete 3D field of rotational ground motions for the first time.

#### <small>August 2015</small> Installation of borehole stations completed

At all three boreholes the installation of stations is completed. The stations are equipped with Nanometrics Trillium 120 Posthole instruments and Centaur recorders. They are named FFB1 (90m, S corner of observatory), FFB2 (15m, NE corner), and FFB3 (15m, NW corner). Data can be retrieved via fdsn webservices.

#### <small>2015/04/12-17</small> ROMY at EGU

At the annual [General Assembly of the European Geosciences Union](http://www.egu2015.eu) in Vienna Toshiro Tanimoto et al. presented their work about ["Estimates of Rayleigh-to-Love wave ratio in microseisms by co-located Ring Laser and STS-2"](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2015/EGU2015-4155.pdf)
<br> </br>


#### <small>2014/11/18</small> Begin of drilling for borehole stations

For the three borehole stations surrounding the ringlaser the drilling of the boreholes has began. The borehole next to the location of the ringlaser with a depth of 90m is the first one to be drilled. The other two boreholes with depths of 15m will be drilled within the next days and weeks.

#### <small>Oct. 2014</small> Additional funding by LMU

The LMU has decided to co-finance the installation of the ring laser in the Geophysical Observatory FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck allowing us to realize our favoured geometry with a tetrahedral shape and 12m side length. Start of construction is planned for spring 2016.

#### <small>2014/07/04</small> Prof. Toshiro Tanimoto visits LMU as CAS Fellow 

Prof. Tanimoto is one of the leading experts on the topic of the Earths
Hum. In September/November 2014 he will visit our group as a CAS
visiting fellow. Together, we will work on questions concerning the Hum
based on ring laser observations. In the context of his visit we will
organize a workshop centered around the Earth Hum (further
information can be found [here](WShum.html)).

#### <small>2014/05/30</small> Successful completion of OBS experiment with a rotation sensor

For the first time a rotation sensor was attached to an ocean bottom instrument and lowered to the shallow sea floor in the North Sea near German island of Helgoland. In cooperation with the Alfred-Wegener Institution (AWI) in Bermerhaven we investigate options to determine the orientation of the sensors at the sea floor and the characteristics of noise on the seafloor. The data are now being analyzed.

#### <small>2013/08/13</small> [ERC Advanced Grant (LMU Press Release)](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/news/newsarchiv/2013/f-m-58-13.html)

LMU geophysicist Professor Heiner Igel has been awarded an Advanced Grant worth 2.5 million euros by the European Research Council (ERC). Igel will use the grant to develop a novel type of rotation sensor for the analysis of seismic waves. ERC Advanced Grants honor European researchers who have already made their mark in their respective fields, and are intended to enable them to undertake innovative and high-risk projects.
