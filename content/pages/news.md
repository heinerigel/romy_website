### <small>2014/11/18</small> Begin of drilling for borehole stations

For the three borehole stations surrounding the ringlaser the drilling of the boreholes has began. The borehole next to the location of the ringlaser with a depth of 90m is the first one to be drilled. The other two boreholes with depths of 15m will be drilled within the next days and weeks.

### <small>Oct. 2014</small> Additional funding by LMU

The LMU has decided to co-finance the installation of the ring laser in the Geophysical Observatory FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck allowing us to realize our favoured geometry with a tetrahedral shape and 12m side length. Start of construction is planned for early summer 2015.


### <small>2014/07/04</small> Prof. Toshiro Tanimoto visits LMU as CAS Fellow 

Prof. Tanimoto is one of the leading experts on the topic of the Earths
Hum. In September/November 2014 he will visit our group as a CAS
visiting fellow. Together, we will work on questions concerning the Hum
based on ring laser observations. In the context of his visit we will
organize a workshop centered around the Earth Hum (further
information can be found [here](WShum.html)). 


### <small>2014/05/30</small> Successful completion of OBS experiment with a rotation sensor

For the first time a rotation sensor was attached to an ocean bottom instrument and lowered to the shallow sea floor in the North Sea near German island of Helgoland. In cooperation with the Alfred-Wegener Institution (AWI) in Bermerhaven we investigate options to determine the orientation of the sensors at the sea floor and the characteristics of noise on the seafloor. The data are now being analyzed. 
 

### <small>2013/08/13</small> [ERC Advanced Grant (LMU Press Release)](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/news/newsarchiv/2013/f-m-58-13.html)

LMU geophysicist Professor Heiner Igel has been awarded an Advanced Grant worth 2.5 million euros by the European Research Council (ERC). Igel will use the grant to develop a novel type of rotation sensor for the analysis of seismic waves. ERC Advanced Grants honor European researchers who have already made their mark in their respective fields, and are intended to enable them to undertake innovative and high-risk projects.
