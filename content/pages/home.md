            <p class="section-paragraph">
            When the ground shakes from earthquakes, the oceans, or the
            atmosphere, it not only translates (up-down, sideways), but
            also undergoes rotational motions. To fully characterize
            seismic sources and wave fields theoreticians have insisted for
            decades that these motions should also be measured. However,
            this was hampered by the substantial technical difficulties in
            observing rotational motions with the necessary sensitivity.
            This implies that the observation of the complete ground motion
            is still an unsolved problem. Based on promising pilot studies
            in the past years, we aim at breaking new ground with an
            innovative instrumentation strategy that would allow solving
            this outstanding problem. If the strategy is successful the new
            observable is expected to have an impact in a wide range of
            fields making it a classical high-risk high-gain situation. We
            aim at the establishment of the first-of-its-kind six-component
            seismic observatory based on ring-laser technology, the field
            deployment of portable fibre-optic based rotation sensors,  the
            integration of the  new observations with the global
            seismological data infrastructure, and the reporting of
            discoveries in a variety of fields based on the new observable.
            At the end of the project we expect to have substantially
            pushed forward the emerging field field of rotational
            seismology with new standards, and recommendations for the use
            of rotation sensors in Earth sciences and engineering. We
            expect advances in understanding 1) the dynamics of volcano’s
            interior, 2) the origin of the Earth’s ocean generated noise
            field, 3) and seismic inverse problems for structure and source
            using the new rotational observables.
