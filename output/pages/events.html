<h4><small>December 2017</small> Special session at AGU</h4>
<p>At the AGU in New Orleans from 11-15 December we offer a special session on <em>GRound translation, strain, rotation: Using Wavefield Gradients for Seismic Applications</em> (Session ID: 23314). Note that abstract submission is already open. Deadline is  <strong>August 2, 2017</strong>.  In total, the <strong><a href="../docs/AbstraktListe.pdf">Romy group presents 11 contribution</a></strong> within this and other sessions. </p>
<p>Session Description:<br>
Substantial recent progress in seismic instrumentation and array technology has opened new roads in using wavefield gradients, strain, and rotation for several seismic applications. Collocated recordings of translation, strain, and rotation provide access to subsurface velocity information, improve the resolution of source inverse problems, help separating seismic phases, and provide information on propagation directions. In addition – due to the sensitivity of classic broadband seismometers to tilt – high quality measurements of ground rotations can remove the ambiguities of horizontal ground motion measurements for example for ocean-bottom recordings or recordings of long-period signals on volcanoes. In this session we invite papers on new developments of seismic instrumentation to access gradient information (e.g., rotation sensors), small scale array measurements and analysis, and applications such as imaging, source inversion, wavefield reconstruction, instrument correction, single station observations 
in planetary seismology and theoretical developments.<br>
Primary Convener: <strong>Heiner Igel</strong>, Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, Munich, Germany<br>
Conveners: <strong>Cedric Schmelzbach</strong>, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, <strong>Nori Nakata</strong>, University of Oklahoma Norman Campus, Norman, OK, United States and <strong>Bor-Shouh Huang</strong>, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan<br>

<h4><small>September 2014</small> Workshop: The Earth's Hum</h4>
<p>The Earth continuously hums a tune, at very low frequencies, audible only to sensitive geophysical instruments. The development and installation of a novel rotational sensor, currently underway at the LMU, will allow us to more closely study the toroidal modes which contribute to the Earth's Hum. Within the scope of the visit of Prof. Toshiro Tanimoto a workshop centered around the Earth's Hum will take place on 12th September 2014 in the building of the <a href="http://www.en.cas.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html">Center for Advanced Studies (CAS)</a> in Munich.
